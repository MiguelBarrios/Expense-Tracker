# Description
This project is a full stack Spring MVC web application. The main purpose of which is to allow a user to keep of their spending habits. From the home page the user will be able to view all the transaction that have been added and a form will be avaliable so that the user can add new transactions. The database consists of 7 fields only 5 of which will be avalible for the user to manipulate through the web application. From the home page the user can also navigate to a search transaction page where the user can filter transactions by category. 

## Technologies 
- Java 
- Spring Boot 
- JPA 
- JPQL 
- JSP

- JUNIT



# Future Features
In the the future I would like to expand this project to allow users to create their own accounts to keep track of own transactions. Additionally I would like to expand the search features to include searching for transaction by a given date range, by keyword, and by a minimum and maximum range for the amount field. I would also like to improve the UI to make it more user friendly. Lastly I would like to add an additional page containing various graphs to help the user gain more insight into their spending habits.

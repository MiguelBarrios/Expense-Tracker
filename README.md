# JPACRUDProject

# Description
This project is a full-stack Spring MVC web application. The main goal of this web app is to allow user's to keep track of their spending habits. From the home page, the user will be able to view all the transactions that have been added. A form is also present in the main map to allow the user to add new transaction. A transaction consist of 7 fields(id, userid, category, sub-catagor,transaction-date,payee) stored on a relational database. From the home page, the user can also navigate to a search transaction page where the user can filter transactions by category. 

## Technologies 
- Java 
- Spring Boot 
- MySQL
- JPA 
- JPQL 
- JSP 
- Gradle 
- JUNIT

## Future Features
In the future, I would like to expand this project to allow users to create their own accounts to keep track of their own transactions. Additionally, I would like to expand the search features to include searching for transaction that are in a given date range, by keyword, and by a minimum and maximum range for the amount field. I would also like to improve the UI to make it more user-friendly. Lastly, I would like to add an additional page containing various graphs to help the user gain more insight into their spending habits.
